            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              Ali Gamal is a journalist and media professional with decades of experience reporting across the Middle East and internationally.
              His work spans politics, culture, crises, and public-interest reporting — with a consistent focus on verification and credibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, Ali has seen how local realities are often filtered through distant narratives, and how independent journalists
              struggle to earn sustainably despite doing the most valuable work: reporting from the ground.

            <h2>Why Here News</h2>
            <p>
              Here News was created from a journalism-first perspective — not tech hype.
              The goal is to build a platform where local journalists can publish verified, location-based stories,
              earn for their contributions, and build reputation through a transparent trust system.
            </p>
            <p class="small notice">
              The differentiator is verification: identity-backed contributor profiles, peer validation, geo-tagged media evidence,
              and optional AI-assisted checks to flag inconsistencies and plagiarism.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card col-12">
            <h2>How the Scientific Project connects</h2>
            <p>
              Here News is the platform. Individual initiatives are verticals that can live within it.
              The <strong>Scientific News Channel Project</strong> is a flagship initiative developed alongside Here News,
              applying the same principles of integrity and respect for primary sources — to science and heritage, with a focus on Arabic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both efforts share one foundation: protect truth from erosion — whether it is breaking news on the ground, or scientific knowledge across centuries.
